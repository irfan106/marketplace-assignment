# AI Models Marketplace

## Overview
Welcome to the AI Models Marketplace project! This project aims to provide a platform for showcasing and exploring cutting-edge AI models and LLMs (Large Language Models). The goal is to facilitate innovation and collaboration among developers and organizations in the AI space.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **UI Libraries**: Material-UI, Emotion.js
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Testing**: React Testing Library
- **Other Dependencies**: dotenv, react-scroll, react-slick

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Middleware**: body-parser, cors
- **Development**: nodemon for automatic server restarting

## Page Load Time
The page load time of the application was measured using Google PageSpeed Insights. You can view the detailed analysis [here](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-irfan-atlan-assignment-netlify-app/ftevrxvl9v?form_factor=desktop).

## Optimization Strategies
To optimize page load time and improve performance, the following strategies were implemented:
- **Code Splitting**: Utilized React's code splitting features to load only necessary code for each page.
- **Lazy Loading**: Deferred loading of non-critical resources using lazy loading techniques.
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed and optimized images to reduce file sizes and improve loading speed.
- **Caching**: Implemented client-side and server-side caching for frequently accessed data and resources.
- **Minification and Bundling**: Minified and bundled CSS and JS files for reduced file sizes.
- **Server Optimization**: Configured server settings and middleware for optimal response times.
